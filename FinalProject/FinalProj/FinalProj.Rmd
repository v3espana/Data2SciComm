# Introduction

As AI technologies and machine learning continue to advance, its integration into everyday life has exponentially increased in recent years. This research investigates brainwave activity for machine learning models to better predict cognitive states using EEG sensors. Identifying patterns could improve AI decision-making systems, such as Tesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving whose semi-autonomous technologies allows cars to accelerate, make turns, and even parallel park, all the while tracking the driver's cognitive state [@tesla_autopilot].

# Research Questions

How do **variations** in EEG sensor values between open and closed eye states reflect changes in brainwave activities, and how can this information be used to train machine learning models for **accurately predicting** cognitive states like attention and mental fatigue?

More specifically, this research aims to determine which sensors are **most predictive** of cognitive state during open and closed eye states.

# Data Source

The dataset used in this study is the *EEG Eye State* database from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It contains EEG recordings from **14** different electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, in which participants were asked to perform tasks with either their eyes **open** (0) or **closed** (1) [@roesler2013eeg]. These sensors are positioned on different areas of the head to measure brainwave activity corresponding to various brain lobes. Each lobe has distinct functions [@jawabri2023cerebral]:

- Frontal Lobe: Responsible for decision-making, emotion regulation, and attention
- Fronto-Central Lobe: Plays a key role in motor control 
- Temporal Lobe: Involved in hearing, language recognition, and memory
- Parietal Lobe: Processes sensory information, such as touch, temperature, pressure, and pain
- Occipital Lobe: Specializes in visual processing

# Results and Interpretation
*Prior to figure creation, the data was cleaned to remove significant outliers that were affecting the overall findings of this research. The data was not altered or changed in any way during cleaning. Plots were created using* **tidyverse** *and* **ggplot** *packages [@R-tidyverse; @R-ggplot2].*

1. Does average EEG sensor values between eye states vary across the different sensors?

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Average EEG Values Across Sensors Separated By Eye State", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8, fig.align = "center"}

# remove major outliers for each sensor
plot1_cleaned <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -eyeDetection, names_to = "Sensor", values_to = "Value") %>%
  group_by(Sensor) %>%
  mutate(Q1 = quantile(Value, 0.01, na.rm = TRUE),
         Q3 = quantile(Value, 0.99, na.rm = TRUE),
         IQR = Q3 - Q1,
         lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR,
         upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR) %>%
  filter(Value >= lower_bound & Value <= upper_bound) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(eyeDetection = factor(eyeDetection, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Open", "Closed")))

# calculate group means
sensor_means <- plot1_cleaned %>%
  group_by(eyeDetection, Sensor) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# plot the means
ggplot(plot1_cleaned, aes(x = Sensor, y = Value, color = eyeDetection)) +
  # add points for the means
  geom_point(data = sensor_means, aes(x = Sensor, y = Mean, color = eyeDetection),
             size = 4, stroke = 1.5, position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Mean Sensor Values by Eye State",
       x = "EEG Sensor",
       y = "EEG Signal Value (μV)",
       color = "Eye State",
       shape = "Eye State") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Eye State",
                    labels = c("Open (0)", "Closed (1)"),
                    values = c("red", "cyan"))+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    text = element_text(size = 20),
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.background = element_rect(color = "black", linewidth = 1)
  )

```


This plot compares the mean signal value of each sensor for both open and closed eye states. Excluding the F8 sensor, the average signal value for all sensors for open eye states were less than or equal to the average signal value for closed eye states. The AF3, F4, F8, and FC6 sensors exhibit significant differences in mean sensor values, suggesting their importance in distinguishing cognitive states.

2. Are the visual processing (O1 and O2) sensors indicative of cognitive state?

```{r table-cleaning, include = FALSE}

# filter for closed
closed_data <- data[data$eyeDetection == 1, ]

# filter for open
open_data <- data[data$eyeDetection == 0, ]

# set bounds for closed O1
Q1 <- quantile(closed_data$O1, 0.01)
Q3 <- quantile(closed_data$O1, 0.99)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# hold the cleaned data in new variable
closedO1data_cleaned <- closed_data[closed_data$O1 >= lower_bound & closed_data$O1 <= upper_bound, ]

# set bounds for open O1
Q1 <- quantile(open_data$O1, 0.01)
Q3 <- quantile(open_data$O1, 0.99)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# hold the cleaned data in new variable
openO1data_cleaned <- open_data[open_data$O1 >= lower_bound & open_data$O1 <= upper_bound, ]

# set bounds for closed O2
Q1 <- quantile(closed_data$O2, 0.01)
Q3 <- quantile(closed_data$O2, 0.99)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# hold the cleaned data in new variable
closedO2data_cleaned <- closed_data[closed_data$O2 >= lower_bound & closed_data$O2 <= upper_bound, ]

# set bounds for open O2
Q1 <- quantile(open_data$O2, 0.01)
Q3 <- quantile(open_data$O2, 0.99)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# hold the cleaned data in new variable
openO2data_cleaned <- open_data[open_data$O2 >= lower_bound & open_data$O2 <= upper_bound, ]

```

```{r table, echo=FALSE}

# calculating min, max, mean for O1 closed
closedO1_min <- min(closedO1data_cleaned$O1, na.rm = TRUE)
closedO1_max <- max(closedO1data_cleaned$O1, na.rm = TRUE)
closedO1_mean <- mean(closedO1data_cleaned$O1, na.rm = TRUE)
closedO1_std <- sd(closedO1data_cleaned$O1, na.rm = TRUE)

# calculating min, max, mean for O1 open
openO1_min <- min(openO1data_cleaned$O1, na.rm = TRUE)
openO1_max <- max(openO1data_cleaned$O1, na.rm = TRUE)
openO1_mean <- mean(openO1data_cleaned$O1, na.rm = TRUE)
openO1_std <- sd(openO1data_cleaned$O1, na.rm = TRUE)

# calculating min, max, mean for O2 closed
closedO2_min <- min(closedO2data_cleaned$O2, na.rm = TRUE)
closedO2_max <- max(closedO2data_cleaned$O2, na.rm = TRUE)
closedO2_mean <- mean(closedO2data_cleaned$O2, na.rm = TRUE)
closedO2_std <- sd(closedO2data_cleaned$O2, na.rm = TRUE)

# calculating min, max, mean for O2 open
openO2_min <- min(openO2data_cleaned$O2, na.rm = TRUE)
openO2_max <- max(openO2data_cleaned$O2, na.rm = TRUE)
openO2_mean <- mean(openO2data_cleaned$O2, na.rm = TRUE)
openO2_std <- sd(openO2data_cleaned$O2, na.rm = TRUE)

# make the table
table <- as.table(rbind(c(openO1_min, openO1_max, openO1_mean, openO1_std), 
                        c(closedO1_min, closedO1_max, closedO1_mean, closedO1_std), 
                        c(openO2_min, openO2_max, openO2_mean, openO2_std), 
                        c(closedO2_min, closedO2_max, closedO2_mean, closedO2_std)))

dimnames(table) <- list(Sensor = c("O1 Open", "O1 Closed", "O2 Open", "O2 Closed"),
                        Metric = c("Min.", "Max.", "Mean", "Std. Dev."))
  

kable(table, caption = "Summary Statistics for Sensors O1 and O2")

```

This table provides summary statistics for the O1 and O2 sensors, which are specific to visual processing. The resulting values contained in this table do not provide any indication of whether or not these sensors are particularly important when predicting cognitive state, as the minimums, maximums, and means were similar across eye states. The standard deviation of the O1 sensor indicates that the underlying distributions may be significant.

3. What do frontal lobe sensors tell us and how can this information be used to by machine learning models to predict cognitive state?

```{r plot2-cleaning, include = FALSE}

#there are some outliers in the data set that are affecting my plots
#taking out the outliers 

#setting ranges for the quartiles
Q1 <- quantile(data$AF3, 0.01)
Q3 <- quantile(data$AF3, 0.99)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

#set the bounds
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

#hold the cleaned data in new variable
plot2_cleaned <- data[data$AF3 >= lower_bound & data$AF3 <= upper_bound, ]

```

```{r plot2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Median Signal Value and Variability of AF3 Sensor", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8, fig.align = "center"}

plot2_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eyeDetection, y = AF3, fill = eyeDetection)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4) +  # add a violin plot for
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, outlier.shape = NA) +  # make boxplot smaller
  labs(title = "EEG Sensor (AF3) Distribution by Eye State",
       x = "Eye Detection",
       y = "EEG Signal Value (μV)") + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Eye State",
                    labels = c("Open (0)", "Closed (1)"),
                    values = c("red", "cyan")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20),
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.background = element_rect(color = "black", linewidth = 1)
    ) 


```
This plot further investigates the AF3 sensor. This sensor tells us that the range of signal values may be more significant that the mean signal value.

# Conclusion

Results consistently demonstrate that closed eye states produced a slightly higher mean signal value compared to open eye states. For many of the frontal lobe sensors (AF3, AF4, F8, FC6), a lower signal value for open states suggests reduced frontal lobe activity as cognitive process are more focused on visual inputs. Additionally, open eye states exhibit a wider signal range than closed eye states. For machine learning systems to accurately predict cognitive state, the variability in signal range between open and closed eye states may aid in distinguishing focus, attention, and fatigue. These findings can drastically improve semi-autonomous AI driving systems, hopefully reducing fatigue-related accidents. Continued research using EEG sensors in active-driving scenarios could further enhance cognitive state prediction models.
