# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Participants

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.


# Results


```{r}

overall_difference <- t.test(weight = Diet,
                             data = filter(ChickWeight, Diet %in% c(1,3)))

apa_output <- apa.print(overall_difference)

```

There is a significant difference in the average weight of chick who received Diet 1 compared to Diet 3, `r apa_output$full_result`.
